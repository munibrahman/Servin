External Accounts
These External Accounts are transfer destinations on Account objects for Custom accounts. They can be bank accounts or debit cards.

Bank accounts and debit cards can also be used as payment sources on regular charges, and are documented in the links above.

Creattion, retrieval, update and deletion for external accounts (Both debit card AND bank accounts) are the same.

The only difference is between listing of all cards and listing of all bank accounts, in which, an object indication whether this is a card or an account must be passed in.
